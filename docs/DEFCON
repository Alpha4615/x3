1) Introduction

    X3 supports a unique protection mechanism based on the military "Defense
    Readiness Condition" (DefCon) system. It is based on 5 levels of defense
    readiness defined as:

    DEFCON5 Normal peacetime readiness
    DEFCON4 Increased intelligence and security readiness
    DEFCON3 Increase in force readiness
    DEFCON2 Further increase in force readiness
    DEFCON1 Maximum force readiness.

    These are configurable levels that mandates what actions X3 should
    take in case of emergency and change in readiness status.

    It is used to prevent abuse to both Services, and the ircd on which they 
    are running. Also to protect the users, primarily in the event of Clones
    and/or FloodBOT attacks. 

2) Installation

    The DefCon system is part of O3,

    The DefCon system has to be configured on your x3.conf file to
    be enabled.

    Make sure you restart X3 after changing the DefCon configuration
    directives.

3) Configuration

    Pre-defined DefCon actions:

    No new channel registrations                       1 
    No New Nick Registrations                          2 
    No channel Mode changes                            4 
    Force Chan Mode                                    8 
    Use Reduced Session Limit                         16 
    KILL any new clients trying to connect            32 
    Services will ignore everyone but opers           64 
    Services will silently ignore everyone but opers 128 
    GLINE all new clients trying to connect          256 
    No new memos sent to block MemoServ attacks      512

    These are the values used to determine each defcon setting, are set via: 

    "DefCon1 "XX";
    "DefCon2 "XX";
    "DefCon3 "XX";
    "DefCon4 "XX";

    To set the desired value, you simply add the value of the numbers together 
    and place that as your DefCon# setting. For instance:

    Say you wish to set: 

    No Channel Registrations, No Nickname Registrations and Services Ignoring 
    everyone except for Operators. You would do this by: 

    1 + 2 + 128 (Each value listed above is added together) 
    Giving: 131 

    You would then place this as which ever Defcon setting you want: 
    
    "DefCon1" "131";

    The recommended default values are safe to use on any network.

4) Usage

    X3 starts up in DEFCON5 (normal readiness) by default, this is configurable.
    To change the Defcon level in action use:
    
    /msg O3 DEFCON 1|2|3|4|5

5) Usage Example

    Place the network on DEFCON3:

    /msg O3 DEFCON 3

    <O3> DefCon is at level 3 and enforcing:
    <O3> No Channel Registrations
    <O3> No Nickname/Account Registrations
    <O3> No ChanServ SET MODE Changes
    <O3> Forcing Channel Mode(s): +r
    <O3> Forcing Reduced Session: 2
    <O3> Allowing Services Communication With Opers Only AND Silently Ignoring Regular Users
    <Global> Network DefCon level has changed to level 3
    <Global> SiRVulcaN is changing the DefCon level to 3

    Note that the last message is sent to Opers only.

    Restore normal readiness:

    /msg O3 DEFCON 5

    <O3> DefCon is at level 5 and allowing everything
    <Global> Network DefCon level has changed to level 5
    <Global> SiRVulcaN is changing the DefCon level to 5

    Note that the last message is sent to Opers only.

    Listing The Currently Set DefCon Settings:

    /msg O3 DEFCON

    <O3> DefCon is at level 3 and enforcing:
    <O3> No Channel Registrations
    <O3> No Nickname/Account Registrations
    <O3> No ChanServ SET MODE Changes
    <O3> Forcing Channel Mode(s): +r
    <O3> Forcing Reduced Session: 2
    <O3> Allowing Services Communication With Opers Only AND Silently Ignoring Regular Users
