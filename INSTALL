   	      X3 Installation Instructions

Introduction:
----------
If you encounter any problems compiling/running X3, please make sure
you have followed the directions in this file correctly and that all
of the requirements listed below are met.

If the problem persists, report it to one (or all) of the coders
listed in the AUTHORS file. Please try to include ALL relevant
information about the error/bug, including anything out of the
ordinary reported from make and the appropriate entries from the log
files.

Requirements:
----------
This release of X3 (1.9) only supports the Undernet P10
protocol and nefarious extensions. It is tested with Nefarious IRCu 
1.3. It does not support bahamut, hybrid, Unreal, or any other ircd 
not listed. Should you find other compatible ircds, please let us know.
Most of the testing has been done on Nefarious IRCu 1.3.0 (Based on ircu2.10.11.x).

X3 is known to compile on the following systems as long as you
are using GNU make (make on Linux, gmake on many other systems):

  * Linux (libc5 or glibc2); glibc2.1 recommended+    (SPARC, ALPHA, x86, PPC)
  * FreeBSD 4.x; tested on 4.2-RELEASE and 4.2-STABLE (SPARC, x86)
  * FreeBSD 3.x; tested on 3.3-RELEASE and 3.4-STABLE (SPARC, x86)
  * FreeBSD 2.x; tested on 2.2.8-RELEASE	      (SPARC, x86)
  * NetBSD 1.6+;                        	      (ALPHA, MIPS, x86)
  * SunOS 5.x; tested on 5.8			      (SPARC, x86)
  * OpenBSD 2.x; tested on 2.8			      (x86)
  * BSDi 4.x; tested on 4.0.1			      (x86)
  * CYGWIN 1.1.x and 1.3.x; tested on 1.1.8	      (x86)

X3 should compile on other system types also.  If you have success
on other platforms/archs or problems on any platforms/archs, please
contact the authors to let us know.

gcc 2.96 tends to emit spurious warnings; before reporting any
compiler warnings from it, make sure you are using the most recent
version of it or try using an official release of gcc.

You may also have trouble unless your compiler's C preprocessor
supports ISO C99 varadic macros.  gcc is the compiler we use for
almost all our testing, and we recommend it for use with X3.

Quick Install:
==============
$ ./configure --prefix=~/x3run  
    # Will install to x3run directory in your home directory
$ make
$ cp x3.conf.example x3.conf
$ nano -w x3.conf
    # use -w (no wrapping) option with nano, or use your favorite editor
$ ./x3
    # launches x3. 
    # Note: x3 runs in the background as a service by default. Give it arguments
    # -f -d  to have it run in the foreground and print debug information.

Detailed Install:
=================
It is generally a bad idea to run or install x3 as root. Choose an account x3
will run under, and configure it to install and run from somewhere that user
has permissions.

Compiling:
----------
  1) cd to the main directory of the X3 source tree.  

     $ cd evilnet-x3serv

  2) Run the configure script with correct arguments. You need to tell configure
     at minimum a path to install to (--prefix). Later, after x3 is working,
     you may want to recompile it with additional modules by adding
     "--modules=memoserv,helpserv" but leave modules out for now.
     
     Configure will verify that your system will have the resources needed for 
     X3 to compile. You should also turn debugging on to assist with setup: 

     $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install --enable-debug

  3) Run "make" to begin compiling.  If you encounter any
     uncorrectable errors/warnings, please scroll up to the introduction
     section and follow the instructions.

     $ make

  4) You may now either type "make install" to install it to your
     installation path, or work from your build directory, either is fine.

     $ make install

  5) Change to the install directory.

     $ cd /path/to/install

  6) Copy x3.conf.example to x3.conf 

     $ cp x3.conf.example x3.conf

  7) The example config contains help to assist you with modifications.
     Remember to begin by only editing the bare minimum ammount you need to
     edit to make it run. Then, when it is working, gradually customize the 
     config more. This way errors can be identified at their source.

     Errors in the configuration file will be logged to
     main.log (and if X3 is running in the foreground with -f, printed to
     stdout) when you start x3. 

     To start with you will want to tell x3 where to connect. Modify the "Hub"
     entry in "uplinks" with your ircd info. You'll need a matching connect
     block in ircd.conf and a server type listen block for the  port.
     
     You probably also want to modify the "hostname", "description", and "prefix",
     "numeric", "admin" etc. Other bits are documented, but generally must match
     how your ircd is configured. 

     $ nano -w x3.conf

  8) You can now run x3 for the first time. You can debug by
     running it with '-fd'. It will not background itself, and it
     will be fairly verbose if you gave the configure script the
     --enable-debug flag. If you would like to run in the foreground
     with no verbosity, use the '-f' flag. If you just want to run it,
     execute X3 without any flags.
     $ ./x3 -fd

  9) Once you have X3 started, you'll need to register a AuthServ
     account:
       /msg AuthServ@services.irc.com register <account> <password>
     Make sure that you register the first account -- it is
     automatically granted owner privileges and gives you admin
     access to O3 once you are opered up.

 10) New operators can be given access to O3 through AuthServ's
     (or whatever you've named the nick/authentication service) oset
     command:
       /msg AuthServ oset <nick>|*<account> level <level>
     Levels are generally beween 0 and 1000 by convention; higher
     numbers correspond to more access. You can also add helpers
     (users with extra privileges such as security override in
     traditional configurations) through AuthServ:
       /msg AuthServ oset <nick>|*<account> flags +H

 11) X3 stores its information in a flat text file (x3.db by default). If
     you shut down x3 first, you can edit this file by hand (but be careful!)
     If you delete it, x3 will start up brand new at step 9 (above) which
     can be handy if you think you have made a mistake.
