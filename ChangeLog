	add?))  note, this needs a version query alert to get the version from
	them.

2006-10-18  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/opserv.c: Minor cosmetic error noticed by Raisk. If doing an
	opserv WHOIS from another service (when bound), the channels reply
	would come from o3 instead of that service.

2006-10-14  Alex Schumann   <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/opserv.c: fix crash Buttaknife noticed if you forget chantarget 
	in svsjoin alerts. Cleanup old silent code fragments left over. Check
	for missing chantarget in alerts also.

2006-10-12  Alex Schumann   <rubin@afternet.org>
	
	* src/opserv.c: Added VERSION alert/trace reaction, so you can now
	setup x3 to version only users matching a criteria, and then another
	alert to do someting based on the version reply. This should be
	usefull for finding bots etc. Or, for example, you can make all xchat
	people join #xchat, or all mirc join #mirc etc.
	Also, there is a fix in here for SVSJOIN which i hadn't gotten
	everything working with.

	* src/proto-p10.c: added privmsg_user and version_user functions

2006-10-12  Alex Schumann   <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/opserv.c: Added SVSJOIN command, to push a user into a channel,
	and a TRACE REACTION of SVSJOIN for trace and alerts. Now you can do
	something like 'trace SVSJOIN chantarget #dronebots nick bot[*'
	or send all level3 users to a perticular channel on connection, etc.

2006-10-12  Alex Schumann   <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/chanserv.c: Make lamers not affect users on the userlist above
	inviteme level in the channel. (why kb users who can .uba and
	.inviteme back in?)

2006-10-10  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/spamserv.c: Ignore those with access (if the options are
	disabled- scanchanops, scanhalfops, scanvoiced.

2006-10-08  Alex Schumann   <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/chanserv.c: undid 9/16/06 change of 5 second delay before
	autojoin. Not really a great solution. Instead, move auth_handler
	funcs to be called after stamping etc. thx to Buttaknife for this
	solution.

	* src/nickserv.c: move auth_func calls to after stamping, and
	commented up the cmd_auth source to make it more managable.

2006-10-04  Alex Schumann   <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/chanserv.c: remove redundant 'none' from empty llists

2006-10-04  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	over with odelcookie now.

2006-10-04  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/chanserv.c: Fix for bug 1551717. If automode is set to 0

	receive autoop etc if they have it enabled in uset.

2006-10-03  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/opserv.c: Check for connect timer entries before adding new
	ones, hopefully will fix bug 1570408 (pLaYa, let us know)

2006-09-25  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/modcmd.c: Shortened ThiefMaster to just his nick as per request
	by him.

2006-09-16  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/chanserv.c: Do autojoin 5 seconds after handle_auth. Seems its

	but with any message. (for use with bindings)

	* src/modcmd.c: enabled the ability to use $a $n and $m in BIND, which
	are replaced with the target command's calling user's account, nick,
	and numnick respectively. This and the above allows things like:
	BIND x3 account x3.reply your account is $a   or

	* src/opserv.c: If we have a city, latitude and longitude returned
	then show a map url. Some results have no city but a latitude and
	a longitude. The coordinates are useless in this case and most
	people would know where the country is around abouts.

2006-08-08  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/hash.c: Speed up city and country lookups significantly.
	Just slow for the first read but once thats done the rest is fast.

2006-08-08  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/spamserv.c: Fix a crash in spamserv (Tracker# 1535968).
	I dont know if this will work for sure as i cant reproduce it. But
	my theory is that once the user is kicked the mode node is dropped.
	Users without modes should still return a valid mode node.

2006-08-08  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/chanserv.c: Fixed a crash with giveownership. X3 would crash
	if a giveownership command was issued in a channel with no owners.

	* src/global.c: Fixed a bug, wasnt message_del'ing some messages.

2006-08-01  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/chanserv.c: Add automode 6, to just voice everyone with access.
	Idea by daniel (thx)

	it doesnt get lost amongst the below messages.

2006-08-01  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/x3.conf.example: Removed the targets option.

	* src/global.c: Wrote new function that will global message users
	and/or opers and/or helpers messages in their own langauge. The
	strings are set either in language files or in the global.c message
	struct. This allows us to send defcon notices to people and they
	will get them in their own language if they have it set.

	* src/global.h: global_message_args decleration.

	* src/opserv.c: Removed targets option for defcon as its too hard
	to send messages to people in channels if the people have different
	language settings.

2006-07-31  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

2006-07-31  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* x3.conf.example: Added new Defcon system settings

2006-07-29  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, tools/tre_install.sh,
	src/opserv.c, src/config.h.in, src/nickserv.c, src/Makefile.am: I am
	not comfortable running 'make install' on libtre from ./configure.
	This violates what the user expects in a way that can harm the system.
	Changed how the libtre checks work and provided easy-to-use install
	script. -fix link stage

	configured. | Voice discovered that the error message for addplan fail
	was typeo'd so not showing.

	* src/opserv.help: slight changes to routing help.

	* src/chanserv.c: let non-staff see when channels were registered with
	.info

2006-07-24  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/proto-p10.c: dont burst channels with 0 users in them (which
	were created by alert discrims, most likely)

2006-07-23  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	have nef 1.0 'b:' lines setup.

2006-07-25  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/nickserv.c: If theres no title set then the default title
	will therefore be the first part of hidden_host in x3.conf.example,
	so for consistency with opt_fakehost we will print this.

2006-07-25  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/nickserv.c: The reason why theres no arg rubin is that
	if you want to print the fakehost then u dont specify an arg.
	This tells opt_fakehost to set fake to the current fakehost
	and pass it on to be printed.

2006-07-23  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/nickserv.c: Add config file regex fakehost test + sanity

	* src/proto-p10.c: Host in topic supports sethost and fakehost
	now.

2006-07-21  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	successes. (All prep for auto routing system) 

	* src/proto.h: Added support for irc_wallop, irc_squit,
	irc_connect, and added callbacks to handle connect failures and

2006-07-16  Neil Spierling  <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* x3.conf.example: Added host_in_topic option for sending full
	nick!user@host if its enabled. Default to one as Nefarious is
	default to TRUE for HOST_IN_TOPIC. There will be wierdness if
	you have this enabled on X3 and not on your Nefarious server.

	* src/proto-p10.c: Make use of host_in_topic.

	cases, if commands are bound to a different bot.

	* src/chanserv.c: make the bot reply from the nick you /msg in all
	cases, if commands are bound to a different bot.

	* src/mod-memoserv.c: Make all memoserv commands reply from the bot you
	msg, not the defined memoserv bot, if commands are aliased to other
	bots. This may also fix the crash bug playa reported at
	http://www.unrealgamers.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=138

2006-07-11  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/chanserv.c: Fixed some weirdness with nef 1.0's 2nd topic setter
	and some x3 topic functions.

	and changed default to 5.

2006-07-11  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/nickserv.c: fixed bug where unignores were getting sent to the
	user multiple times, instead of to each online nick once.

2006-07-09  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/nickserv.c: Fixes for addignore/delignore corruption +missed a
	spot. Ugh, messed up the fix. Trying again :)

2006-07-10  Neil Spierling <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/chanserv.c: INVITE now checks the targets ignore/silence list.
	If the target is ignoring the person inviting them then the invite
	is denied.

2006-07-07  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/mod-memoserv.c: pLaYa reported a crash/corruption bug in
	memoserv most easily seen when sending short memos. Rewrote the flag
	handling part of memo send to correct it.

2006-07-05  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	* src/helpfile.c: pLaYa pointed out the table code row count is off by
	one. Fixed.

2006-06-27  Neil Spierling <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* configure: Regenerated.

	* configure.in: Make use of TRE regexp library. Its more powerful
	than the standard library (http://laurikari.net/tre/index.html).
	Im also pondering adding services side regexp bans, X3 would
	probably required a channel flag called say advanced that can
	only be set by the owner. If enabled then regexp bans can be
	used. I also added an output saying what modules are enabled,
	what protocol is enabled, what malloc is choosen and if debugging
	is enabled. Just a bit of a message as the user will of seen
	programs just finish compiling and he/she/it may think it
	was X3 compiling, but it was just TRE compiling. They still need
	to compile X3.

	* src/config.h.in: Regenerated.

	* src/Makefile.am: Tweak for TRE.

	boxes out there still without bzip.

2006-06-25  Neil Spierling <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* src/mod-memoserv.c: Better history implementation. A seperate
	table is used for history entries. Entries contain the same
	fields as the memo table except for the message, read, and flags.
	Entries are only removed from the history db when they get
	expired by do_expire (older than message_expire). Also fixed
	up a issue with STATUS. On AfterNET we were getting huge large
	for the amount of memos. I now realise it was reading the amount
	of users. It now reads the proper amount of memos. I also a count
	for history entries.

	in the help file.

	* src/mod-memoserv.help: Added read recipient relevent bits.

	* src/mod-memoserv.c: Added SET LIMIT option for the maximum
	amount of memos you can have. This does not do anything yet as

	allows you to adjust the limit for now.

2006-06-12  Neil Spierling <sirvulcan@gmail.com>

	* x3.conf.example: Commented out SpamServ module as there are bugs

2005-05-27  Reed Loden  <reed@reedloden.com>

	* src/chanserv.c: Fixed an incorrectly named message. Fixed some
	grammar issues in the message send to pending users. Fixed a
	problem with some of the resync code.

	* src/modcmd.c: reed pointed out that modcmd non-command help wasnt
	working, and pointed me to the opserv helpfiles command, which shows
	what services search what help files.  This fixes the help command to
	search that list as it should. Still need to modify the 'default'
	helpfile search bindigs because I dont think chanserv should respond
	to help from opserv's db, etc.  See opserv's 'helpfiles' command.

	* src/modcmd.help: clarified 'helpfiles' help.

2005-05-18  Alex Schumann  <rubin@afternet.org>

	errors so svccmd_send_help can 'take control' of things.
