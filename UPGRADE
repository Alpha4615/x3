*** IMPORTANT UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS ***
**************************************
Generally version-to-version upgrades can be done without trouble. The code
for the most part aims to be backward-compatable. You should back up the .db
files first (but you back those up anyway, dont you?)

Sometimes when upgrading, some commands may have changed. When you upgrade
your .db file may not have command bindings for new commands added.
There is now a command to assist with this: rebindall.
If you don't have the 'rebindall' command bound, first bind it:
    /msg O3 bind o3 * *modcmd.*
Then, after any upgrade, or after adding modules, or changing command effecting settings
such as 'email', you can simply run:
    /msg O3 rebindall
to ensure you have all the latest commands bound on all services.

You may do: 'bind nick * *module.*' to re-bind ALL builtin commands on a givin module,
(chanserv, opserv, nickserv, modcmd, etc) if you prefer to update them individually
(if you unbind some default commands, and want them to stay unbound).  
Alternatively you can edit the .db by hand or using the 'bind' command on irc. 
NOTE: You will need to shut down x3 gracefully (using the die or restart commands)
after binding in order for 'set' and 'uset' subcommand changes to function properly since
the listings are cached.
