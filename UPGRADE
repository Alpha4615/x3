*** IMPORTANT UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS ***
**************************************
From srvx 1.4:
  Rename srvx.conf to x3.conf
  Review .conf file settings. 
    * remove giveops, givevoice from set_shows and add "Voice" above "Protect".
    * you can change from srvx.db to x3.db here also (dont forget to rename the file)
  Run all of the steps below

As of CVS version 1.24:
  bind chanserv 'uset autoop' and 'set voice' (see note below).


NOTE about command bindings:
You may do: 'bind x3 * *chanserv.*' to re-bind ALL builtin commands on chanserv. This
is the simplest approach and probably a good idea to run for each module (chanserv, 
opserv, nickserv, modcmd, etc) after upgrading or changing some features (such as email).  
Alternatively you can edit the .db by hand or using the 'bind' command on irc. 
IMPORTANT: You will need to shut down x3 gracefully (using the die or restart commands)
after binding in order for 'set' and 'uset' subcommand changes to function properly since
the listing is cached.
