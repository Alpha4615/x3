**************************************
*** IMPORTANT UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS ***
**************************************
From srvx 1.4:
  Rename srvx.conf to x3.conf
  Review .conf file settings. 
    * remove giveops, givevoice from set_shows and add "Voice" above "Protect".
    * you can change from srvx.db to x3.db here also (dont forget to rename the file)
  Run all of the steps below


*****************************
NOTE about command bindings:
*****************************
From srvx to x3, and within versions of x3, some commands have changed. When you upgrade
your .db file may not have command bindings for new command names. I have added a command
to help make solving this easy.
If you don't have the 'rebindall' command bound, first bind it:
    /msg O3 bind o3 * *modcmd.*
Then, after any upgrade, or after adding modules, or changing command effecting settings
such as 'email', you can simply run:
    /msg O3 rebindall
to ensure you have all the latest commands bound on all services.

You may do: 'bind nick * *module.*' to re-bind ALL builtin commands on a givin module,
(chanserv, opserv, nickserv, modcmd, etc) if you prefer to update them individually
(if you unbind some default commands, and want them to stay unbound).  
Alternatively you can edit the .db by hand or using the 'bind' command on irc. 
NOTE: You will need to shut down x3 gracefully (using the die or restart commands)
after binding in order for 'set' and 'uset' subcommand changes to function properly since
the listings are cached. 

*********************************************
*** Steps needed, by version:
***   note, binding can be taken care of
***   according to the note above.
*********************************************
As of CVS version 1.24:
  bind chanserv commands: uset autoop, and set voice

As of CVS version 1.29:
