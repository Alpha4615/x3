---------------------------
- 0.9.5 released March 21, 2001.
- This is the LAST release before 1.0 goes out.
- We came across a (large) memory leak in FreeBSD's libc and worked
  around it.  We also submitted a bug report to the FreeBSD team.

News for everything prior to 0.9.5
[April 16, 2000 - March 20, 2001]
----------------------------------
- Coding began about 1 year prior to the 0.9.5 release.
- Documentation up to 0.9.5 is virtually non-existant.
- PRE01 released April 16, 2000.
- PRE02 released April 18, 2000.
- After the main parts were completed, it all came down to bug fixing.
- 0.1 released June 13, 2000.
- srvx was setup on a machine and linked to GamesNET for its initial beta
  tests.  Many many many bugs were fixed in the first week, fewer as time
  went along.
- 0.2 released July 5, 2000.
- Between 0.2 and 0.7 code for the services themselves was put in.  Prior
  to this was mainly core coding.
- Using dmalloc, bounds-checking and new log replaying code, we were able
  to hammer out alot bugs, some of which were severe enough to cause a
  segfault.
- 0.7 released December 15, 2000.  [0.3 through 0.6 never released]
- 0.9 released January 17, 2001.   [0.8 never released]
- Just prior to the 0.9.5 release, numerous memory leaks were fixed,
  prompting the release of 0.9.5.
- srvx is still running smoothly on GamesNET.  If we didn't take it down
  every 2 days to be updated with new patches, its uptime would be quite
  high.
